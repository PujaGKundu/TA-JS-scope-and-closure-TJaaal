1. Convert the function below into different forms of function expression.

```js
function percentage(marks, total) {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
}

// Your code goes here
let percentage = function (marks, total) {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
}

let percentage = (marks, total) => {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
}


```

2. Write Function Declaration or Function Expression next to the function.

```js
function percentage(marks, total) {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
}
// Function Declaration

```

```js
let percentage = function percentage(marks, total) {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
};

// Function Expression
```

```js
let percentage = function (marks, total) {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
};

// Function Expression
```

```js
let percentage = (marks, total) => {
  return (marks * 100) / total;
};

// Function Expression
```

```js
let percentage = (marks, total) => (marks * 100) / total;

// Function Expression
```

3. Why is a function definition an expression in JavaScript? Give one example of function expression.
If a function is first defined and then called it's known as function declaration, whereas if a function is stored in a variable in an expression form it's known as function expression.

```js
function square (num) {
  return num * num;
} //Function Declaration

let square = function (num) {
  return num * num;
} //Function Expression
```

4. Why is a function call an expression in JavaScript?
As function is an object in JavaScript. Thus, if a function is stored in a variable in an expression form it's known as function expression. 


5. Write VALID and INVALID next to each example below with the reason.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let five = add(2, 3); // Valid (as the function is been called with parameters)
five = add; // Valid (as the function is not been called with parameters, it's a function reference)
five = five(10, 11); // Valid (as the function is been called with parameters, also the variable five is already reclared to store the value)
five = function () {
  return 'Hello';
}; // Valid (as it is a function expression)
```

6. What is the difference between function definition and function call? Explain with an example.
Function defination is when we define a function and function call is when we execute the function.

```js
function add (num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
} // Function Defination

add (2,6); // Function call
```


7. What is the similarities between function definition and function call?
Similarty is execution of a function.

8. Is the code below valid or invalid. Explain with reason.

```js
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello World!');
}

hello.user = 'Sam'; // valid (As function is an object in JavaScript)
```

9. What is higher order function explain with an example.
When a function defination is been passed but not a function call inside another function it is a higher order function.
```js
let number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let isEven = (num) => {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}
let isOdd = (num) => {
  return num % 2 !== 0;
}
function filter (arr, cb) {
  let array = [];
  for (let i of arr) {
    if (cb(i)) {
      array.push(i);
    }
  }
  return array;
}
console.log(filter(number, isOdd));
console.log(filter(number, isEven));
```

10. Explain what is callback function. Why you can pass a function inside a function?
A function that is passed a a parameter to a higher order function is known as a callback function. As function is an object in JavaScript and object is an expression, thus, a function can be passed inside a function.
